# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts the type of Iris flower using simple measurements like petal and sepal length and width. It includes both a script and a simple web app using Streamlit.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary
We use the famous Iris dataset to train a model that can classify flowers into:

- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

---

## 💡 What’s Included
- Python code for training and testing a model
- A simple web interface using Streamlit
- Visualization of results (like confusion matrix)

---

## 📂 Dataset Info
- File: `Iris.csv`
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Label: Species of the Iris flower

---

## 📊 Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier** (from scikit-learn)

Libraries used:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- streamlit

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

### 1. Install the libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Python script (for training + testing)
```bash
python iris_flower_classifier.py
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit web app
```bash
streamlit run iris_streamlit_app.py
```

---

## 🌼 What You Can Do in the Web App
- Use sliders to enter petal and sepal measurements
- Click "Predict Species"
- See the predicted Iris flower name

---

## ✨ Future Ideas
- Try more models like SVM or KNN
- Show feature importance
- Put the app online using Streamlit Cloud
